# Algorithm & Data structure 

This course has for goals to teach you the basics of algorithm and data structure. 
How to use them, in a context what difference they make, you will also see how to evaluate the performance of them.

## This course will be composed of 4 semesters: 

### Semester 1: 

This semester is about core concepts of algorithms, you will learn about simple data structure, algorithms and also 
techniques to analyze them. The concepts of this semester will be used multiple times across the next ones 

These concepts are divided in 17 chapters (15 + 2 bonus): 
* Chapter 1: Algorithm, Time complexity, Merge sort 
* Chapter 2: Data structures, binary heap, heap sort 
* Chapter 3: Quick sort, order statistics 
* Chapter 4: Lower bound for sorting, Radix sort, Sorting networks
* Chapter 5: Binary search 
* Chapter 6: Stacks, Queues, Amortized costs 
* Chapter 7: Linked List, Pointer machine 
* Chapter 8: Disjoint sets (Union-Find)
* Chapter 9: Fibonacci heap
* Chapter 10: Dynamic Programming - PART I
* Chapter 11: Dynamic Programming - PART II
* Chapter 12: Knapsack 
* Chapter 13: Dynamic programming on subsets, on profiles 
* Chapter 14: Hash Tables 
* Chapter 15: Perfect & Cuckoo hashing, Bloom filter

* Bonus 1: Time complexity of union-find (inverse Ackermann function)
* Bonus 2: Eval-Link update
